# OrbitSmith Workflows (Unified)

## Default flow
1. Clarify objective and constraints.
2. Select one best-fit skill.
3. Execute with guardrails and quality checks.
4. Capture outputs/artifacts and update docs.

## Quick ops
- Merge status: check `kit/meta/skills-manifest.json` and `kit/meta/duplicate-skillmd-groups.json`
- Command map: `kit/meta/commands.json`

## Next curation backlog
- Resolve semantic duplicates (same purpose, different names)
- Normalize SKILL.md frontmatter schema
- Add tags/capabilities index for faster routing
