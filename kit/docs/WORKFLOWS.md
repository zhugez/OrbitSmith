# Antigravity Workflows

> Workflow playbooks to orchestrate multiple skills with less friction.

## What Is a Workflow?

A workflow is a guided, step-by-step execution path that combines multiple skills for one concrete outcome.

- **Bundles** tell you which skills are relevant for a role.
- **Workflows** tell you how to use those skills in sequence to complete a real objective.

If bundles are your toolbox, workflows are your execution playbook.

---

## How to Use Workflows

1. Install the repository once (`npx antigravity-awesome-skills`).
2. Pick a workflow matching your immediate goal.
3. Execute steps in order and invoke the listed skills in each step.
4. Keep output artifacts at each step (plan, decisions, tests, validation evidence).

You can combine workflows with bundles from [BUNDLES.md](BUNDLES.md) when you need broader coverage.
