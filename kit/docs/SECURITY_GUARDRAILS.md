# 🛡️ Security Guardrails & Policy

Antigravity Awesome Skills is a powerful toolkit. With great power comes great responsibility. This document defines the **Rules of Engagement** for all security and offensive capabilities in this repository.

## 🔴 Offensive Skills Policy (The "Red Line")

**What is an Offensive Skill?**
Any skill designed to penetrate, exploit, disrupt, or simulate attacks against systems.
_Examples: Pentesting, SQL Injection, Phishing Simulation, Red Teaming._

### 1. The "Authorized Use Only" Disclaimer

Every offensive skill **MUST** begin with this exact disclaimer in its `SKILL.md`:

> **⚠️ AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**
> This skill is for educational purposes or authorized security assessments only.
> You must have explicit, written permission from the system owner before using this tool.
> Misuse of this tool is illegal and strictly prohibited.

### 2. Mandatory User Confirmation

Offensive skills must **NEVER** run fully autonomously.

- **Requirement**: The skill description/instructions must explicitly tell the agent to _ask for user confirmation_ before executing any exploit or attack command.
- **Agent Instruction**: "Ask the user to verify the target URL/IP before running."

### 3. Safe by Design

- **No Weaponized Payloads**: Skills should not include active malware, ransomware, or non-educational exploits.
- **Sandbox Recommended**: Instructions should recommend running in a contained environment (Docker/VM).

## 🔵 Defensive Skills Policy

**What is a Defensive Skill?**
Tools for hardening, auditing, monitoring, or protecting systems.
_Examples: Linting, Log Analysis, Configuration Auditing._

- **Data Privacy**: Defensive skills must not upload data to 3rd party servers without explicit user consent.
- **Non-Destructive**: Audits should be read-only by default.
